# ferris-scriptural-tray

This is a Java stand-alone scripture alert application which uses the windows
system tray for alerting.  The binary of this project
can be downloaded, unziped, configured, and run with no additional setup
needed (it even comes with it's own JRE so not even Java needs to be installed
on the server). 

See the project's documentation for more details.
