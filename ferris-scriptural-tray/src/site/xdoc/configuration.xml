            <p>
                Configuring Scriptural is not that difficult.  
                This page documents everything you need to do.
            </p>
        </section>
		
        <section name="JRE">
            <p>
                Scriptural requires Java 8 and JavaFX 8. The release download comes with an
                embedded JRE, so there is nothing more for you to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you want to override the JRE that comes embedded
                with Scriptural, you can do so by editing, the 
                <code>[SCRIPTURAL_HOME]/bin/start-scriptural.cmd</code> file.              
            </p>            
        </section>
		
        <section name="Logging">
            <p>
                See the <a href="logging.html">Logging page</a> for more information
                about configuring logging.
            </p>
        </section>
		
        <section name="Alert Frequency">
            <p>
                Scriptural will randomly choose a scripture and display it based
                on a time interval you define. Open the
                <code>[SCRIPTURAL_HOME]/conf/conf.properties</code> file in a 
                text editor and edit the following property <code>scriptural.alert.frequency</code>:  
            </p>
            <source>
# This is the interval in which a verse is alerted.
# The values are in minutes.  The 1st value must
# be less than the 2nd value.  Both values must be
# greater than zero.  The interval values are 
# inclusive.  Here are some examples:
#
#  30,10     ERROR: 1st value must be less than 2nd value
# -10,-20    ERROR: Both values must be greater than 0
#   0,30     ERROR: Both values must be greater than 0
#
#  29,41     Alert shown randomly between 
#            29 minutes (inclusive) and 
#            41 minutes (inclusive).
#
#  30,90     Alert shown randomly between 
#            30 minutes (inclusive) and 
#            90 minutes (inclusive) from now

        <section name="Verses URL">
            <p>
                Scriptural gets the list of verses it displays from a URL.
                The URL can be any valid Java URL format, such as: <code>http:</code> 
                <code>https:</code> or <code>file:</code>.
                Open the <code>[SCRIPTURAL_HOME]/conf/conf.properties</code> file in a 
                text editor and edit the following property <code>scriptural.verses.url</code>:
            </p>
            <source>
#
# This is the URL of the source of the verses data.
# The example below pulls the raw data file from the
# Scriptural GitHub repository.  A data file may also
# be on your computer.  Follow these URL formats.
#
# http://hostname/context/path/verses.txt
# https://hostname/context/path/verses.txt
# file:/C:/some/local/directory/verses.txt
#
scriptural.verses.url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjremijan/ferris-scriptural/master/ferris-scriptural-verses/src/main/verses/verses.txt
